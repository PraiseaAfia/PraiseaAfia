This is my assignment submission for the HNG stage one task. I was tasked to create a shopping app that has two items on the dashboard and displays items statically.

Features
Display list of products.
Add and remove items from the checkout list.
Navigate to an order successful screen from the checkout screen.
Built using only native Flutter components.
